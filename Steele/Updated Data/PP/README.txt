Recommended use of spring bloom parameters:
   SeaWiFS for 1998-2007
   MODIS for 2008-2011
   VIIRS for 2012-present

The following SeaWiFS spring bloom parameters should be used with extreme caution:
   Bay of Fundy - High sediment area.
   Estuary - High sediment area.
   Green-St._Pierre_Bank 2006 - Very high values compared to MODIS, currently under investigation.
   Hibernia 1999 - Lower data coverage at peak.
   Hudson_Strait 1998-2007 - Low data coverage.
   Northern_Labrador_Shelf 1998-2007 - Low data coverage.
   Southeast_Shoal 2006 - Amplitude may be artificially high due to low data coverage at peak.

The following MODIS spring bloom parameters should be used with extreme caution:
   Avalon_Channel 2013 - Amplitude may be artificially high due to lower data coverage at peak.
   Bay of Fundy - High sediment area.
   Central_Scotian_Shelf 2003 - Amplitude may be artificially high due to cloud edge or pass edge values.
   Estuary - High sediment area.
   Georges_Bank 2008 - Amplitude may be artificially high due to cloud edge or pass edge values.
   Hamilton_Bank 2014 - Low data coverage at peak.
   Hibernia 2006 - Low data coverage at peak.
   Lurcher 2014 - Low data coverage at peak.
   Northeast_GSL 2007 - Parameters based on initial peak, second smaller peak a few weeks later.
   Northern_Labrador_Shelf 2014 - Low data coverage at peak.
   Northwest_GSL 2005, 2010, 2012 - Parameters based on initial peak, second smaller peak a few weeks later.
   Southeast_Shoal 2007 - Low data coverage at peak.
   St.Anthony_Basin 2008, 2017 - Gaps in data near peak.
   Western_Scotian_Shelf 2014 - Parameters based on initial peak, second smaller peak a few weeks later.

The following VIIRS spring bloom parameters should be used with extreme caution:
   Bay of Fundy - High sediment area.
   Bravo 2019 - Low data coverage.
   Estuary - High sediment area.
   Hamilton Bank 2012-2014, 2016 - Low data coverage.
   Hibernia 2017 - Amplitude may be artificially high due to edge of pass values.
   Hudson Strait 2013, 2016, 2018 - Low data coverage.
   Magdalen_Shallows 2017 - Parameters based on initial peak, subsequent bloom shortly afterwards.   
   Northern_Labrador_Shelf 2015 - Low data coverage.
   Northwest_GSL 2012 - Parameters based on initial peak, second smaller peak a few weeks later.
   St.Anthony_Basin 2014 - Low data coverage.
